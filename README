The aim of the internship in Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University in Warsaw is to extend an existing Blender based framework, allowing to make interactive presentation(PowerPoint style) with 3D capabilities:
- Displaying 3D objects and texts
- Creating custom animations and slide transitions ect...

For starting the exemple project: start scripts/__start_example.py (Pyton 3.5+ required)
Then in Text editor (window with Python code) do Alt+R (reload) and Alt+P to activate the menu.

Once all elements are linked to the project, and all slides are configured, go to:
Properties Window > Render Tab > Standalone Player > Start button
